            <strong>Payment and Reporting</strong><br> You agree as follows:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    For each month or a portion thereof in which you used the NATOMX SDK, NATOMX will make a payment to you based solely on the Net Revenue received by NATOMX from validated purchases (which have not been cancelled) made through links reached via the NATOMX
                    SDK on your Application in such period, as determined by NATOMX’s payment tracking method (<strong>“Payment”</strong>).<br>
                    <strong>“Net Revenue”</strong> shall mean revenue actually received less an administrative fee of no more than 10 percent to cover collections, serving and administrative costs, among others.<br> Notwithstanding the foregoing, NATOMX
                    shall be entitled to withhold from any Payments due hereunder any amounts it is required by law to withhold in respect of any withholding tax at the maximum rate for such withholding, unless it is provided with an exemption from such
                    withholding tax in respect of such Payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by NATOMX, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Publisher.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that your entitlement to Payments under this Agreement is expressly conditioned upon your satisfaction and continued compliance with the qualifications set forth above as well as the terms and conditions
                    of this Agreement. If at any time during the term of this Agreement, you fail to satisfy the qualifications and/or the terms and conditions of this Agreement and/or any part thereof, any amounts otherwise payable to you during the
                    period of such failure will be deemed unearned and will not accrue to your account.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We will grant you access to an online reporting tool to view traffic activity and estimated Payments generated from your Application via the NATOMX SDK. However, you acknowledge and agree that said tool provides a non-binding estimate only, and that the
                    final and binding information for the activity generated via the NATOMX SDK through your Application shall be separately provided to you by NATOMX (the “Periodic Report”). You acknowledge and agree that the Periodic Report shall be
                    the definitive record according to which the Payment(s) shall be calculated and that the Payment(s) shall be calculated solely based on records maintained by NATOMX.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You acknowledge and agree that NATOMX shall have the right in its sole discretion to credit, adjust or discount Payments to you based on its sole and absolute determination of quality of the traffic or source (i.e. – if not generated from countries supported
                    by NATOMX) generated via the Application and the NATOMX SDK or due to cancellations and/or returns and to offset future Payments to you based on such credits, adjustments or discounts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You further acknowledge and agree that NATOMX shall have no obligation to issue any Payment(s) to you if NATOMX has not received remittance from the relevant merchant of all monies due from it to NATOMX. In the event of such non-payments or bad debts,
                    NATOMX reserves the right to offset future Payment(s) to you or invoice you for such amount owed in its sole discretion. Your recourse for any such adjustment due to non-payment shall be to contact NATOMX in writing explaining your
                    claims regarding the Payment(s).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Subject to your continued compliance with all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, NATOMX will issue the Payment for the Net Revenues actually received during the previous month, 60 days after the last day of that month, subject to a minimum payment
                    of US$100, or such other minimum payment as NATOMX may establish (the <strong>“Minimum Payment”</strong>). Account balances of less than the Minimum Payment will remain in your account until a balance of the Minimum
                    Payment is met.
                </li>
                <li>
                    NATOMX will pay you any amounts due to you under this Agreement via wire transfer or PayPal, at its sole and absolute discretion. You acknowledge and agree that you will bear all commissions imposed on such transfers and that all such commissions shall
                    be deducted from the funds transferred to you and considered as having been paid to you. All Payment(s) due under this Agreement shall be made in U.S. Dollars, Euros, GBP or other currency, as applicable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    NATOMX reserves the right to suspend, withhold or adjust any Payment to you in the event of any suspected or actual violation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement or any part thereof, as may be amended from time, and in particular, NATOMX reserves
                    the right to suspend, withhold or adjust any Payment based on any amounts which result from clicks generated by any person, robot, automated program or similar device in violation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as shall
                    be reasonably determined by NATOMX, including without limitation any valid clicks intermingled with invalid clicks. You agree to forfeit and/ or have offset any payments made which are determined by the sole and absolute discretion
                    of NATOMX to have been generated by you or from your Application via the NATOMX SDK in violation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You agree to pay all applicable taxes, including any applicable value added tax (VAT) or other similar taxes, imposed by any government entity in connection with your engagement in this Agreement. You are solely responsible for providing and maintaining
                    accurate contact and payment information with NATOMX. You agree to provide us with any payment and/or tax information reasonably requested by us for the purposes of transferring any Payment(s) due to you under this Agreement; in the
                    event that such information shall not be dully provided, NATOMX reserves the rights to suspend or withhold any Payment(s) due to you hereunder, until such information is duly provided.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Any questions or claims by you regarding any charges or payments must be raised with us in writing within 30 days after the date of transfer of the Periodic Report to you, or else the charges or payments will be deemed final and will not be subject to
                    any further claims or disputes. No refunds, credits or other billing adjustments will be made if a question or dispute is not asserted by you in writing within 30 days from the date of transfer of the Periodic Report to you.
